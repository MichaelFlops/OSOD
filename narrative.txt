       The Open Source Dynabook

Concept: Future mathbooks need to be dynamic and interactive.  The age
of the paperless office will do more than save trees, it will engage students
by allowing them to interact with a multi-media world making devices like the 
ipad, the kindle, other mobile devices, and the web all to be a greater 
participant in creating a better educational environment.
 
The vision from Alan Kay of the Dynabook and Open Source by Richard
Stallman in the early 80's can fuse together by creating an open source 
textbook. 

For this to happen authors need new tools that help authors interact with 
mathematical equations, plots, multi-media and more.

Our group has coded a new language/system capable of seamlessly blending 
together formatted text markdown input (easily formatted notes, add 
images, html and more, mathjax)  It will work on any device that supports 
HTML5 and Javascripta.  The simplicity of our system, allows for greater 
scrutiny with regards to security in the web.

Similar concepts are being explored by UC Berkeley in the creation of the 
IPyNotebook.  The concept being that a Ph.D. Thesis can be presented in 
IPython Notebook and that will be able to include a dynamic demonstration
and testable code.

Our Open-Source Dynabook and IPython Notebooks are both examples of the 
blending of code and documentation in the style proposed by Donald Knuth
in the 80's with his literate programming proposals.
